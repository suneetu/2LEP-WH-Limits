## 1. Convert the root file with hypo test results into a readable 'list' file.

cd macros/contourplots
root -b -q makelistfiles.C

##    this example produces two list text files with p-values, that can be read in in root
##    by doing : root -l summary_harvest_tree_description.h
##    which gives you a tree with the results

## 2. make contour histograms based on these list files

root -b -q makecontourhists.C 

## --> The underlying script used here is to make the histograms is : contourmacros/m0_vs_m12_nofloat.C

## 3. make final plots based on histograms

root -b -q makecontourplots.C

## --> The underlying script to make the plots is : contourmacros/SUSY_m0_vs_m12_all_withBand_cls.C
## the plots are stored under plots/

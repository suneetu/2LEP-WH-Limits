2012-08-29 HistFitter Todo list

https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=204995

Prioritized todo-list:
======================

>>> Top priority: Crashes & fixes & documentation: 
>>> (At a minimum, let's try to do this before the post-mortem)

- Update tutorial to work with latest tag. (GJ)
- Root 5.34.03: RooPlot has problems with ratio plots (alex)
- Bug in filling of weight based systematics (GJ, David)
- Using minos in fit (Max)
- Remove MC statistical fluctuations from systematics (Max)
- Proper treatment of all bins with zero events by HistFactory? Check (See recent mail George Lewis)


From 2012-11-12:
- HistFitter running okay on Ubuntu?
- Example of log-normal constraints (for low event statistics)
- non-truncated p-value when deficit (check Zach's recent commits)
- sigma values in list-file.

- Move tutorial examples to HFUser?
- document new systematic uncertainties (Max)
- Absolute errors in case of nominal prediction with 0.0 events. Empty nominal, non-empty systematic (Marcello)
- Hard-coded names, e.g. sig_xsection. Needs to be documented, or made flexible. (Jeanette?)
- Contour scripts for plotting the new theoretical error. Properly available and documented? (Yu?)
V Directory driven results structure (Zach)
  o possibility to propagate cut-values to output files/dir (Jeanette)
- better support for histogram-based running (Marcello)
  o More debugging output. E.g. _correct_ list of input histograms to be used by histfactory
- Memory leak for running toys (?) Need reproducable example. (Sigve)
- Documentation needs cleanup. E.g Documentation of various available systematics. (David,Alex,Max)
- Make tutorial uptodate with trunk. (David,Alex,Max)
- Generalized scripts (Alex)
- Once tag without XML is public, remove XML methods for tag after that, and rewrite the internal
  lists in sample.py to dictionaries instead of arrays (GJ)

>>> Next: Useful additions & Extra documentation:

- FAQ
  o FAQ on failed fits and how to handle them. Guideline on when a fit / grid-of-fits is okay. (All, Zach, Max)
  V Better rejection of bad fits that make it into grid list file (Zach had some tricks for this - discuss) (Zach, Max)
- Analysis script sharing (--> first: get overview: Jeanette, Sophie?)
  o Generalized scripts? E.g. for visible x-section limits (by Alex)
  o e.g. script/option for p0 calculation, making pull plots, drawing pdf, contour plots. (Alex)
- review and improve consistency and configurability of automatic error handling (David) 
- Merging of configManager code (0-lepton) (G-J, Max, Yu)
  o 0-lepton: switching between multiple signal regions. (python magic words)
- Correct statistical treatment of fits to prescaled data. (Max)
- Make HistFtter use proper logging (GJ)

>>> External: RooFit/RooStats bugs we are affected by:

- RooFit toys crash (Wouter Verkerke)
- VisualizeError() bug for single bin (Wouter Verkerke)

>>> On slightly longer time-scale:

- Manpower situation. Rotation of mailing-list help. (All)
- Histogram recycle option with running with -t. (Do per channel?) (Who?)
- Python code cleanup: implement polymorphic design for Systematic and Sample python config objects (Marcello)

=================================================================================================


Full list of open items:
========================

Zach:
V Better rejection of bad fits that make it into grid list file (Zach had some tricks for this - discuss)
- Correct statistical treatment of fits to prescaled data.
V Treatment of negative QCD weights: can lead to crash in signal region. 
- Hard-coded names, e.g. sig_xsection. Needs to be documented, or made flexible.
- Scripts for plotting the new theoretical error. Properly available and documented?
- Sharing of common scripts: e.g. p0 calculation, making pull plots, drawing pdf, contour plots.
V Directory driven results structure
- FAQ on failed fits and how to handle them. 
- Guideline of when a fit / grid-of-fits is okay.


Michael:
- the choice of nuisance parameters in blind analyses 
- and expected limits (from some mails I saw that this is currently implemented/ investigated)
- one sided uncertainties or in general propagation of uncertainties from performance groups

Sophie & Marcello:
- Absolute errors in case of nominal prediction with 0.0 events. Empty nominal, non-empty systematic
- When using histogram inputs, specify the range of the input histograms to be used (used to be supported by RooStats?)
- Cleanup of python code: propose derived classes for various available systematics
- More debugging output 
- Sharing of analysis scripts. 
   Eg. batch submission scripts.
   Systematics table with each individual systematic turned off (iterate)
- UL derived with toys. RooFit crash.
- better support for histogram based running

Jeanette:
- For optimization studies, possibility to propagate cut-values to output files/dir
- Make contour plot as a HistFitter option? I.e. combine all steps into one?

Sigve:
- RooFit Toys generation/fitting crash
- Memory leak for running toys (?)
- FAQ would be useful to have.
- Analysis script sharing?
- General remark: ROOT plotting scripts can be difficult

Geert-Jan:
- Merge 0-lepton fitter changes into HistFitter trunk
- Mem-leak for running over many grid-points? (Jeanette says no.)
- Update to Root v5.34
- Implement HistFitter xml-python hooks -- apparently need input from George Lewis

Jovan:
- Encourage more support for using histograms directly instead of trees, 
  such as having a standard way to configure histogram files and names.

Alex:
- Histogram recycle option with running with -t.
   (Do per channel?)
- How to deal with bin with 0 bkg-prediction content, include it in the fit or not?
- Verbose: _correct_ list of input histograms to be used by histfactory
- Quoting ofr correct MC stat errors in tables -> constact RooStats. 
- Asymmetric error propagation
- VisualizeERror bug for single bin, still to be fixed by Wouter
- Plotting multiple channels together (TR+WR or TREl+TRMu), already tried with PlotPdfSumWithComponents, but unsuccesfull so far
- Add command line option for plotting NLL, correlation matrix, etc  ----> DONE

David:
- magic words for cmd line option. python -c "foo=True"
- automated histogram fix (zero entries) --> configurable, logging info
- swapping of one-sided up/down-systematics fixed? 
- Support for absolute errors. 
- histograms as input: name specifiable, and -v2 option needs to be exact.
- batch system support
- 0-lepton: switching between multiple signal regions.
- Generalized script for visible x-section limits (by Alex)
- Finish polymorphism for systematics ("methods")
- Merge measurement class with TopLevelXML
- asymmetric binning

Alex & David:
- replace XML by direct python calls to histfactory
- implement polymorphic design for Systematic and Sample python config objects
- generalize Yields, Systematics, Pulls and visible cross-section scripts
  o Almost done on all the generalized scripts, last one/still in progress Systematics table.
  o Are other any other scripts/tables that we/people generally want to produce? Separate stat error + syst error?
  o Error before the fit? What should be the default? None, only MC stat, everything? Easy to trick oneself, 
    if before fit is 4 +/-2 and after fit 3 +/- 1.5. Reduction of error from 2 -> 1.5 (25%). 
    NO, error is relative in HistFitter/HistFactory.
  o Old VisualizeError bug (for single bin histograms, but maybe also for all extended pdf histograms(?)) without fix yet from Wouter.
  o How to visualize Systematic Error inputs? I have a script, but it needs to be generalized. 
    Important for understanding the fit result, specifically in case of large profiling.
- review and improve consistency and configurability of automatic error handling 
  (also eventually discuss this with HistFactory guys as well)--> by this i mean negative or empty histograms and so on.
- Discuss with HistFactory people about MC stat error nuisance parameters, and validity for showing the error per sample.
- What about zero-bins for MC stat error (bRPV signal MC example)? Talking 
  to Sven Kreiss, he was originally surprised that it wasn't used, 
  but after discussing with George Lewis was not sure how to move forward. The problem has to do with setting the right scale for it.
- Possible to not rerun -t every time, but if changing only the binning of one region, maybe copy all histograms, except for this one.
- Make sure that HistFitter runs with -t, or -t -w, or just -w. Not always the case anymore.
- Non-symmetric error propagation
- Large systematics for small backgrounds (BG in 1lepton PRD), WARNINGS?


Max:
- Documentation needs cleanup.
- Documentation of various available systematics.
- Tutorial uptodate? Do all tutorial examples work? Need to check (I believe they do.)
- Cleanup of python code
- Request for FAQ
- Upgrade to ROOT v5.34; xml files okay?
- New histogram interpolation default in latest root version.
- Divergence of code:
- Blinding  currently only in configMananger.py_blinding

- Merge 0-lepton code into HistFitter
   Cmd line options: choose between exclusion/discovery/bkg-only fits
   Cmd line options: Choose which signal region to run on.
   Renormalization of systematics over control regions 
   Useful scripts for merging latex tables

- Readdition of symmetrization of systematic errors.

- Correct statistical treatment of weighted (pre-scaled) datasets
   Razor analysis.

- Recommit logicalOR.py script.
- Presentation of MC stat errors in Tables.
- Commit HistFitter code in ROOT
- Lets share our table/plot/submission scripts. Eg. Pull plots
- Manpower situation. Rotation schedule for Histfitter support and mailing list
